## [3.0.0](https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/compare/v2.0.1...v3.0.0) (2026-04-26)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **preprocessing:** `LinearlyInterpolateTS()` no longer silently fills
endpoint NaN; callers that relied on the implicit fill must opt in
via `on_missing="ffill_bfill"` (or `"passthrough"` if they want to
handle residuals themselves). In-tree callers updated:
- preprocessing/imputation.py: switched to `passthrough` so residual
  NaN flows into the existing post-imputation WARNING path instead of
  being silently bridged.
- manager/models/forecaster_recursive_model.py: 8 callsites switched
  to `ffill_bfill` to preserve the fit-time invariant that no NaN
  reaches the estimator.

Tests: existing tests updated for the new defaults; new tests cover
the raise path, the ffill_bfill leading-NaN behaviour, the
passthrough residual-survival behaviour, and the invalid-value error.
quartodoc reference page regenerated.
