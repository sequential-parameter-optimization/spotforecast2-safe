# Security Policy & Vulnerability Reporting

This page documents the security measures and vulnerability reporting process for spotforecast2-safe.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, DO NOT create a public GitHub issue. This puts all users at risk.

### Primary: Private Security Advisory

Use GitHub's **Private Security Advisory** feature:

1. Go to: https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/security/advisories
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Provide details about the vulnerability

### Alternative: Email Reporting

Email your findings to:

```
bartzbeielstein@users.noreply.github.com
```

Subject line: `[SECURITY] spotforecast2-safe Vulnerability Report`

### What to Include

Provide as much detail as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected version(s)
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact and severity
- Suggested fix (if available)

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to all vulnerability reports promptly:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 3 business days
- **Fix and patch**: Varies based on severity (critical issues prioritized)
- **Public disclosure**: Coordinated after patch is available

## Security Advisories

Published security advisories are available at:

https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/security/advisories

## Supported Versions

The following versions receive security updates:

| Version | Status | End of Support |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| 0.3.x   | Supported (Current) | October 2027 |
| 0.2.x   | Limited Support | February 2026 |
| < 0.2.0 | Unsupported | N/A |

We recommend using the latest version. Check [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spotforecast2-safe/) for the current release.

## Security Features & Design Goals

spotforecast2-safe is designed with security in mind:

**Zero Dead Code**
- No GUI components, plotting libraries, or AutoML frameworks
- Minimal external dependencies (see below)
- Reduced attack surface for supply chain security

**Deterministic Operations**
- All transformations are bit-level reproducible
- Predictable behavior enables auditing
- No hidden randomness or stochastic operations

**Fail-Safe Processing**
- All transformations validate input data
- Invalid data raises explicit errors
- No silent failures or data imputation
- NaNs and Infs are rejected immediately

**Minimal Dependencies**

Core dependencies are carefully selected to minimize the CVE surface:

- astral - Solar position calculations
- feature-engine - Feature preprocessing
- flake8 - Code linting
- holidays - Holiday calendars
- lightgbm - Gradient boosting (optional)
- numba - JIT compilation
- pandas - Data handling
- pyarrow - Parquet/Arrow support
- requests - HTTP client
- scikit-learn - ML utilities
- tqdm - Progress bars

**Supply Chain Security Measures**

- ✅ Dependencies pinned with compatible release specifiers
- ✅ Dependabot enabled for automated dependency updates
- ✅ GitHub Actions pinned to specific commit hashes
- ✅ REUSE compliance for license tracking of all code
- ✅ Regular security scanning via bandit and Safety
- ✅ CPE identifiers for vulnerability tracking

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Using Current Version

1. Always use the latest available version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spotforecast2-safe/)
2. Review CHANGELOG.md for security patches (in repository)
3. Monitor [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/releases) for updates
4. Subscribe to security advisories at the GitHub link above

### Production Deployment

1. Pin exact versions in `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`
2. Use virtual environments (venv or conda)
3. Keep dependencies updated
4. Review [MODEL_CARD.md](safe/MODEL_CARD.md) for safety-critical considerations
5. Enable automatic dependency updates (Dependabot)

### Development

1. Clone only from the official GitHub repository
2. Verify GPG signatures on releases (recommended)
3. Use `pre-commit` hooks for code quality
4. Run security checks locally (bandit, Safety)
5. Follow contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](contributing.md)

## Dependency Management

### Monitoring Dependencies

To check for known vulnerabilities in your environment:

```bash
# Install Safety
pip install safety

# Check installed packages
safety check
```

This project uses:
- **Dependabot**: Automated checks for outdated and vulnerable dependencies
- **bandit**: Code security analysis
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Pinned Versions

All dependencies use compatible release specifiers to allow patch updates while preventing breaking changes:

```
dependency>=1.2.3,<2.0
```

This approach ensures:
- Security patches are automatically available
- Breaking changes are avoided
- Supply chain integrity is maintained

## CI/CD Security

All commits to main and develop branches undergo automated security checks:

1. **REUSE Compliance**: License header verification for all files
2. **Code Quality**: Black, isort, ruff, mypy formatting and linting
3. **Security Scanning**: bandit for code vulnerabilities, Safety for dependencies
4. **Test Coverage**: pytest with minimum coverage thresholds
5. **Dependency Analysis**: Dependabot for outdated packages
6. **Build Artifacts**: Verified and scanned before deployment

## Compliance Standards

spotforecast2-safe follows these compliance standards:

- **REUSE Compliant**: All files have SPDX license identifiers
- **SPDX**: Standards-based license tracking
- **EU AI Act Ready**: Support for compliance via [MODEL_CARD.md](safe/MODEL_CARD.md)
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Monitored for security practices
- **Python 3.13+**: Requires latest Python version for security patches
