# Contributing to spotforecast2-safe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to spotforecast2-safe! This document provides guidelines and requirements for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please treat all community members with respect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or later
- uv package manager (install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe.git
cd spotforecast2-safe
```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the project with development dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Run the test suite to verify setup:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## Building the Package

To build the source and binary distributions (wheels):

```bash
# Using the standard build tool
uv run python -m build

# The artifacts will be in the dist/ directory
ls -lah dist/
```

## Documentation

Update or create documentation:

- API documentation goes in `docs/api/`
- Processing guides go in `docs/processing/`
- Preprocessing guides go in `docs/preprocessing/`
- Use Markdown with Google-style docstring conventions

Build documentation locally:

```bash
uv run python docs/quartodoc_build.py
uv run quartodoc interlinks
uv run quarto render --no-cache
```

or

```bash
uv run python docs/quartodoc_build.py; uv run quartodoc interlinks; uv run quarto render --no-cache
```


Open the generated documentation in a local browser:
```bash
open _site/index.html 
```



## Coding Standards

All contributions must adhere to the following standards:

### Code Formatting

- Code style: Black (enforced)
- Import sorting: isort
- Linting: flake8

Run formatting tools before committing:

```bash
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=180
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
```

### Documentation Style

- Docstrings: Google style format
- All public functions, classes, and modules must have comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints in function signatures
- Include usage examples in docstrings where applicable

Example:

```python
def get_cpe_identifier(version: str = "*") -> str:
    """Generates the CPE 2.3 identifier for the spotforecast2-safe project.

    This function constructs a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3 formatted
    string that uniquely identifies the spotforecast2-safe software.

    Args:
        version: The specific version of the software. Use wildcard "*" to match
            all versions, or provide a semantic version string. Defaults to "*".

    Returns:
        str: The formatted Common Platform Enumeration 2.3 string.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If version is not a string.

    Examples:
        Generate a CPE identifier for all versions:

        >>> get_cpe_identifier()
        'cpe:2.3:a:sequential_parameter_optimization:spotforecast2_safe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*'

    See Also:
        https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-188.pdf
    """
```

### SPDX License Headers

All source files (Python, YAML, etc.) must include SPDX headers at the top:

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: <year> <your name>
# SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later

"""Module docstring."""
```

The project uses REUSE compliance for license tracking. Run the REUSE check:

```bash
uv run reuse lint
```

## Testing Requirements

All contributions must include tests covering new functionality:

- Write tests in `tests/` directory following the existing naming convention: `test_*.py`
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Aim for high code coverage (minimum 80% for new code)
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/spotforecast2_safe
```

Test files should also include SPDX headers and follow the same style guidelines.

## Type Hints

Python 3.13+ features optional type hints are encouraged for all new code. Use precise types to improve IDE support and catch errors early:

```python
from typing import Optional

def process_data(values: list[float], threshold: Optional[float] = None) -> dict[str, int]:
    """Process a list of values."""
    pass
```

## Commit Messages

This project uses Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits for automatic changelog generation.

Commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types (required):
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes only
- style: Changes that do not affect code meaning (formatting, SPDX headers)
- refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Test additions or changes
- chore: Changes to build system, dependencies, or other non-code changes

Example:

```
feat(cpe): add CPE identifier generation for compliance tracking

Implement get_cpe_identifier() function to generate NIST CPE 2.3
formatted strings for vulnerability tracking and SBOM management.

Closes #42
```

## Pre-PR Verification (required)

Before pushing a branch or opening a Pull Request, run the **full** local
verification pipeline and make sure every step is green. Most GitHub Actions
failures on this project — broken doc deploys in particular — would have been
caught by running these four commands locally first.

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -q                                            # full suite
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
uv run python docs/quartodoc_build.py && uv run quartodoc interlinks
uv run quarto render --no-cache                                    # full site render
```

Why this matters:

- **`{python}` example blocks in docstrings are executed at `quarto render`
  time, not by pytest.** A green test suite tells you the library works; it
  does not tell you the docs build. The two are independent.
- **Past failures that local rendering would have caught**: escape stripping
  inside `{python}` blocks (`\n` becoming a real newline at docstring-parse
  time, breaking the rendered cell); the strict `on_missing='raise'` default
  rejecting NaN rows in bundled demo CSVs; missing modules and broken
  cross-references after a rename or move.
- **Run the whole pipeline, not just the page you changed.** A rename can
  break tests in modules you didn't touch, and a doc page can fail only when
  the render runs end-to-end (kernel state, package install order). Per-page
  renders are useful while iterating, but only the full render matches what
  CI runs.
- If a change spans `spotforecast2-safe` and the sibling `spotforecast2`,
  run both repos' pipelines locally before opening either PR.

If a step fails, fix it locally and re-run the **entire** pipeline. Pushing a
partial fix and "letting CI tell you what's left" wastes everyone's time and
pollutes the workflow-run history.

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit with conventional commit messages
3. Ensure all tests pass and code standards are met
4. Create a Pull Request against the `develop` branch
5. PR description should clearly explain:
   - What problem it solves
   - How the solution works
   - Any breaking changes

Pull Request title should follow the conventional commit format.


## Safety-Critical Standards

This is a safety-critical library. Contributions must maintain:

- Deterministic behavior (same input = same output, bit-level reproducible)
- Fail-safe operation (explicit errors, no silent failures)
- Auditability (white-box code, clear logic, comprehensive tests)
- Minimal dependencies (no unnecessary external packages)

Any changes that affect these properties must be clearly documented and justified in the PR.

## Threat-model update rule

Every network-facing module carries a STRIDE threat-model table in its module
docstring. The table enumerates, for every data flow, which of the six STRIDE
categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial
of Service, Elevation of Privilege) apply, which countermeasure is in force,
and where that countermeasure is implemented.

The network-facing modules currently covered are:

- `src/spotforecast2_safe/downloader/entsoe.py` (ENTSO-E Transparency Platform)
- `src/spotforecast2_safe/weather/client.py` (Open-Meteo API)

**Rule.** Any pull request that changes the network-facing attack surface MUST
update the STRIDE table in the module docstring of every affected file in the
same commit. "Changing the attack surface" means any of:

- adding, removing, or redirecting an outbound request;
- changing the parser, schema, or validation of an external response;
- adding, removing, or altering the handling of a credential, secret, or
  session token;
- changing the on-disk cache format, location, or trust boundary;
- adding a new network-facing module under `src/spotforecast2_safe/`.

Pure refactors, docstring fixes, and test-only changes do **not** trigger this
rule.

The rule is enforced as a self-certification item in
`.github/pull_request_template.md` ("Threat-model update" section). Reviewers
reject PRs that check the "attack-surface change" box without showing a diff
to the corresponding module-level STRIDE table.

This rule closes the IEC 62443-4-1 SR-1 / SR-2 (threat-model-driven security
requirements) and EU AI Act Article 9 (lifecycle risk management) obligations
listed in the compliance tables of `MODEL_CARD.md` and of the technical
report `bart26h/index.qmd`.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a bug:

1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Run the latest version to confirm the bug persists
3. Include reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual behavior

Security issues should not be reported in public issues. Email security concerns directly to bartzbeielstein.
