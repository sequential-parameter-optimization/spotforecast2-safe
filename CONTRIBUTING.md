# Contributing to spotforecast2-safe

Thank you for your interest in contributing to spotforecast2-safe! This document provides guidelines and requirements for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please treat all community members with respect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or later
- uv package manager (install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe.git
cd spotforecast2-safe
```

2. Create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the project with development dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

4. Run the test suite to verify setup:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

### Building the Package

To build the source and binary distributions (wheels):

```bash
# Using the standard build tool
uv run python -m build

# The artifacts will be in the dist/ directory
ls -lah dist/
```

## Coding Standards

All contributions must adhere to the following standards:

### Code Formatting

- Code style: Black (enforced)
- Import sorting: isort
- Linting: flake8

Run formatting tools before committing:

```bash
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=100
```

### Documentation Style

- Docstrings: Google style format
- All public functions, classes, and modules must have comprehensive docstrings
- Include type hints in function signatures
- Include usage examples in docstrings where applicable

Example:

```python
def get_cpe_identifier(version: str = "*") -> str:
    """Generates the CPE 2.3 identifier for the spotforecast2-safe project.

    This function constructs a Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) 2.3 formatted
    string that uniquely identifies the spotforecast2-safe software.

    Args:
        version: The specific version of the software. Use wildcard "*" to match
            all versions, or provide a semantic version string. Defaults to "*".

    Returns:
        str: The formatted Common Platform Enumeration 2.3 string.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If version is not a string.

    Examples:
        Generate a CPE identifier for all versions:

        >>> get_cpe_identifier()
        'cpe:2.3:a:sequential_parameter_optimization:spotforecast2_safe:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*'

    See Also:
        https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-188.pdf
    """
```

### SPDX License Headers

All source files (Python, YAML, etc.) must include SPDX headers at the top:

```python
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: <year> <your name>
# SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later

"""Module docstring."""
```

The project uses REUSE compliance for license tracking. Run the REUSE check:

```bash
uv run reuse lint
```

## Testing Requirements

All contributions must include tests covering new functionality:

- Write tests in `tests/` directory following the existing naming convention: `test_*.py`
- Use pytest as the testing framework
- Aim for high code coverage (minimum 80% for new code)
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/spotforecast2_safe
```

Test files should also include SPDX headers and follow the same style guidelines.

## Type Hints

Python 3.13+ features optional type hints are encouraged for all new code. Use precise types to improve IDE support and catch errors early:

```python
from typing import Optional

def process_data(values: list[float], threshold: Optional[float] = None) -> dict[str, int]:
    """Process a list of values."""
    pass
```

## Commit Messages

This project uses Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits for automatic changelog generation.

Commit message format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types (required):
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes only
- style: Changes that do not affect code meaning (formatting, SPDX headers)
- refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Test additions or changes
- chore: Changes to build system, dependencies, or other non-code changes

Example:

```
feat(cpe): add CPE identifier generation for compliance tracking

Implement get_cpe_identifier() function to generate NIST CPE 2.3
formatted strings for vulnerability tracking and SBOM management.

Closes #42
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `develop`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit with conventional commit messages
3. Ensure all tests pass and code standards are met
4. Create a Pull Request against the `develop` branch
5. PR description should clearly explain:
   - What problem it solves
   - How the solution works
   - Any breaking changes

Pull Request title should follow the conventional commit format.

## Documentation

For larger features, update or create documentation:

- API documentation goes in `docs/api/`
- Processing guides go in `docs/processing/`
- Preprocessing guides go in `docs/preprocessing/`
- Use Markdown with Google-style docstring conventions

Build documentation locally:

```bash
uv run mkdocs serve
```

## Safety-Critical Standards

This is a safety-critical library. Contributions must maintain:

- Deterministic behavior (same input = same output, bit-level reproducible)
- Fail-safe operation (explicit errors, no silent failures)
- Auditability (white-box code, clear logic, comprehensive tests)
- Minimal dependencies (no unnecessary external packages)

Any changes that affect these properties must be clearly documented and justified in the PR.

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub Issues for bug tracking and feature requests. This is the primary channel for reporting problems.

GitHub Issues: https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/issues

### Before Reporting a Bug

1. Check [existing issues](https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/issues) to avoid duplicates
2. Run the latest version to confirm the bug persists
3. Verify you are using Python 3.13 or later
4. Prepare a minimal reproducible example

### What to Include in a Bug Report

- Python version and OS
- spotforecast2-safe version
- Minimal code that reproduces the issue
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Full error message/traceback

Use the [Bug Report Template](https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) when creating a new issue.

### Public Issue Archive & Search

All issues, reports, and community responses are maintained in a publicly searchable archive:

- **Issues Archive**: https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/issues
  - Browse all reported bugs, feature requests, and their resolutions
  - Search by keywords, labels, or date
  - View full discussion history and resolution details

- **Discussions Archive**: https://github.com/sequential-parameter-optimization/spotforecast2-safe/discussions
  - Community questions and answers
  - Feature discussions
  - Search across all past discussions

This archive is maintained indefinitely and is fully searchable, allowing users to:
- Find solutions to common problems
- See how previous issues were resolved
- Learn from community discussions
- Verify if a bug has been reported before

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Security issues should NOT be reported in public issues. See our [Security Policy](.github/SECURITY.md) for the proper reporting procedure.
