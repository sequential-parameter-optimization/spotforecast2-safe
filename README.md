## Safety-Critical Design Goals

`spotforecast2-safe` is a specialized Python library designed to **facilitate** time series forecasting in safety-critical production environments and embedded systems. 

Unlike standard machine and dep learning libraries, it follows a strict **"Safety-First"** architecture by design. **However, users must independently verify that these features meet their specific regulatory requirements:**

- **Zero Dead Code**: We aim to minimize the attack surface by excluding visualization and training logic.
- **Deterministic Logic**: The algorithms are designed to be purely mathematical and deterministic.
- **Fail-Safe Operation**: The system is designed to favor explicit errors over silent failures when encountering invalid data.
- **EU AI Act Support**: The architecture supports transparency and data governance, helping users build compliant high-risk AI components.

For a detailed technical overview of our safety mechanisms, see our **[MODEL_CARD.md](MODEL_CARD.md)**.

An extended version of this library with visualization and additional features is available at: [https://sequential-parameter-optimization.github.io/spotforecast2/](https://sequential-parameter-optimization.github.io/spotforecast2/)
